 The maps made on the territory of Ialomita county were made for the bachelor's work, and the other maps were made in the sign of Geomorphology, at the faculty, on a region given by the teacher. Some maps from the seminar come with explanations in Romanian.

Unfortunately, as a result of the Windows change of the laptop, I lost the map files and managed to recover only the maps themselves.
